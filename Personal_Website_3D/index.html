                   <h3 class="section-heading">Introduction</h3>
                   <p class="section-text">Hey there! I'm Aryan Choudhary, a Computer Science and Applied Mathematics enthusiast with a passion for creating captivating web experiences. I'm currently pursuing my degrees at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where I'm honing my skills and exploring the exciting world of data science through a minor.</p>
                   <h3 class="section-heading">Clubs and Extracurriculars</h3>
                   <p class="section-text">One of the clubs that has been a significant part of my journey is TechX, where I have had the privilege of serving as the Rush Chair. In this role, I've been the so-called “gatekeeper” of the society, responsible for identifying and recruiting top talent. Fostering cohesion within the society has been a passion of mine, actively participating in executive board meetings and organizing gatherings. During the exciting rush process, I've had the opportunity to create and implement rituals that reflect the unique TechX culture while ensuring a successful orientation for new members.<br><br>

                       Another exciting aspect of my journey has been my involvement with HackNC. Not only have I competed in this thrilling hackathon, but I've also been actively involved in setting it up. The experience of bringing together like-minded individuals to brainstorm and build innovative projects has been truly rewarding. HackNC has provided a platform for me to push my creative boundaries, collaborate with talented individuals, and showcase my skills in a fast-paced, competitive environment.<br><br>

                       Outside of the tech realm, you'll find me indulging in two of my passions: cooking and swimming. I love experimenting in the kitchen, trying out new recipes and flavors. There's something incredibly satisfying about creating delicious dishes that bring people together. On the flip side, swimming allows me to unwind and stay physically active. It's a meditative experience that helps me clear my mind and find balance amidst the demands of a fast-paced tech world.

                   <h3 class="section-heading">Personal Items Showcased in Website</h3>
                   <p class="section-text">Growing up, Avatar: The Last Airbender held a special place in my heart as my all-time favorite childhood show. The captivating storyline, rich character development, and beautifully crafted world of bending elements left a lasting impression on me. Little did I know that this animated series would go on to inspire and shape many of my application essays during my academic journey.<br><br>

                       In addition to the profound impact of Avatar: The Last Airbender, I also find joy and companionship in the presence of my lovable Goldendoodle named Kai. With his wagging tail and infectious energy, Kai brings endless laughter and love into my life. Whether we're going on adventurous walks, playing fetch in the park, or simply cuddling up for a movie night, he has become an integral part of my family and a constant reminder of the joy and simplicity that animals bring to our lives.<br><br>

                       As such, these two important and memorable parts of my life are shown on the web page both on the computer, playing the intro to Avatar: The Last Airbender, and on the shelfs where a painting of Kai is located.

                   <h3 class="section-sub-heading">June 2023 - Current</h3>
                   <p class="section-text">This project revolutionizes the recruitment process, offering a simplified and optimized solution. By harnessing the power of web scraping, natural language processing, and web development technologies, we have created a robust platform that grants users access to an extensive database of recruiter information. Here are the key features that make our platform stand out: <br><br>
                       Comprehensive Data Extraction: Leveraging the capabilities of Playwright, Beautiful Soup, and Selenium in Python, this platform extracts essential details from recruiter LinkedIn profiles. This includes information such as their name, location, company, and job title. By continuously updating and maintaining the database, we provide users with accurate and up-to-date information.<br><br>
                       Intelligent Data Formatting: To enhance user readability and understanding, we employ natural language processing algorithms to format the extracted data in a user-friendly manner. This enables users to analyze and interpret the information effortlessly, making informed decisions during the recruitment process.<br><br>
                       User-Friendly Interface: Built with Node.js, our platform features a streamlined and intuitive interface. Users can navigate seamlessly and efficiently, saving valuable time and effort. Our platform enables users to effortlessly search for recruiters based on their specific criteria, ensuring a targeted and personalized recruitment strategy.<br><br>
                       Enhanced Recruitment Insights: Our platform empowers job-seekers, hiring managers, and talent acquisition professionals with valuable insights into the recruiter landscape. By accessing a comprehensive database, users gain access to a wealth of information that enables them to make informed decisions and optimize their recruitment strategies.<br><br>
                       In addition to these cutting-edge features, this project demonstrates strong skills in Node.js, natural language processing (NLP), web scraping, Beautiful Soup, and Python. This project has revolutionalized the recruitment experience and helping individuals and organizations thrive in the ever-evolving job market.<br><br>

                   <h3 class="section-sub-heading">January 2023 - April 2023</h3>
                   <p class="section-text">In a collaborative effort, our team developed an interactive view for an internal club that empowered the executive team to efficiently manage their members' exams and plan meetings accordingly. By leveraging JavaScript and React, we crafted a dynamic backend that seamlessly integrated with SQL to efficiently handle the database management. On the frontend, we utilized JavaScript, CSS, and a Node.js framework to create a visually appealing and user-friendly interface. To establish a reliable connection between the backend SQL queries and frontend requests, we incorporated Axios HTTP. This comprehensive solution provided the executive team with real-time insights into members' exam schedules, facilitating effective scheduling and ensuring productive meetings. Our project showcased our proficiency in JavaScript, React, SQL, HTML/CSS, and Node.js, and exemplified our ability to deliver tailored solutions that address specific organizational needs.<br><br>

                   <h3 class="section-sub-heading">January 2023 - April 2023</h3>
                   <p class="section-text">This website has been meticulously crafted using JavaScript and the Node.js platform, complemented by HTML and CSS, to deliver a captivating and user-friendly experience. As my first venture into website design, this project sparked my passion for the field and ignited my interest in web design.<br><br>
                       With great attention to detail, I have curated both the design and functionality of this website to ensure a seamless user experience. It serves as a platform for visitors to gain valuable insights into my background and explore my passions. From TechX @UNC to various personal endeavors, this website showcases the breadth of my experiences and highlights the beginning in my journey as a web designer.<br><br>
                       While I no longer update this project and the information found is primitive, it serves as a good example of how a simple project done for a club can slingshot into a website with animations, 3d designs, and a much more intuitive feel.<br><br>
